# The New Money Landscape

## Overview

This repository contains the research and code for the project **"The New Money Landscape"** The research applies Gary Gorton's concept of No Questions Asked (NQA) money to both stablecoins and fiat currencies, allowing for a comparative analysis between these and other forms of private money.

### Project Objectives
- To analyze how different forms of money (stablecoins, fiat currencies, and private money) achieve or fail to achieve NQA status.
- To standardize these forms of money using the USD as a benchmark for comparison.
- To quantify and compare the convenience yield across different currencies, highlighting why some are more accepted than others in global markets.
- To explore how macroeconomic factors, such as inflation and crises, affect the convenience yield and distance to NQA for these currencies.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `/data`: Contains all datasets used in the analysis, including data on stablecoins, fiat currencies, and bond prices (e.g., Nigerian bonds, U.S. T-bills).
- `/scripts`: Contains the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. This includes Python scripts for scraping bond prices and calculating convenience yields.
- `/results`: Stores output files, including tables, figures, and summary statistics from the analysis.
- `/literature`: Contains key academic papers and references, such as Gary Gorton's "Making Money" and other relevant literature used in the project.
